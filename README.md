* Data

Corporate credit ratings, issued by specialist agencies, provide an assessment about the credit worthiness of a company and acts as a pivotal financial indication to potential investors. It helps provide investors with a concrete idea about the risk associated with the company’s credit investment returns. Every company aims to attain a good credit rating for seeking more investment and lower debt interest rates.

Most of the credit rating agencies have a unique discrete ordinal rating scale. The rating scale of the S&P is: {AAA, AA+, AA, AA−, A+, A, A−, BBB+, BBB, BBB−, BB+, BB, BB−, B+, B, B−, CCC+, CCC, CCC−, CC, C, D} – a total of 22 grades that are ordered from AAA, the most promising one to D, the most risky one. 

S&P broadly classifies the companies with rating higher than BB+ as investment grade companies and others as junk grade companies.  Credit ratings are mostly determined by financial ratios coming from balance sheets, income statements, and cash-flow statements.
